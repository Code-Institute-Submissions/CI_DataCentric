# Code Institute Data Centric
Project Amphora
- Repository of knowledge
- Discover Myths, Legends and fantastic creatures

## Purpose
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.
## Features
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## UX
- Wireframe
- Planning board
- User stories
At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Functionality


## Installation & Deployment
**How did you do it**

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku). 
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch? In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally

## Technologies Used
> In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
